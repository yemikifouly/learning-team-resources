# Learning Team Internal Resources

Hello Team!

This is the repository for the Learning Team. This repository was created for us to keep all our internal resources here so that they are easily accessible to all the members of the team and the members of the team alone.

Each internal team has a folder. Team Leaders are free to organize these as they see fit.

The general-resources folder is used to store the resources of the team that are not team-specific.

There is also a folder to keep the minutes of our minutes for future reference.
